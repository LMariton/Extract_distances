# Extract_distances
Scripts to extract distance from points

### ExtractingMinDistCESBIO :
This script extracts the minimum distance between studied sites and a land use 
category from the CESBIO (ex. deciduous forest, pasture, etc.) in meters.
Those sites have to be in metropolitan France (and Corsica).
It returns a dataframe with the site IDs and the minimum distance from the 
land use category chosen.
